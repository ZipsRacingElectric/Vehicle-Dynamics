## Getting Started
This repository contains a collection of scripts and models used for vehidle dyanmics analysis. Refer to the documentation for each folder. Some scripts may make use of a vehicle parameter model which reflects the latest vehicle design.

### Using tire data with this repository
Commiting tire data to this repository may violate confidentiality agreements. On your cloned repository, use the following directory only to store this information:

/MATLAB/tire_model/

All contents of this directory get ignored when your commit your changes. For some of the MATLAB scripts you may need to grab the required tire model from the OneDrive and place it in this directory.

### Using vehicle data across multiple scripts
The vehicle model scripts under /MATLAB/vehicle_data/ allow you to use consistent vehicle parameters across multiple VD scripts.

### Prerequisite Tools
