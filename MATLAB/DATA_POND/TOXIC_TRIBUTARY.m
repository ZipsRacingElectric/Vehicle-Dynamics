% test function to upload data from motec, mattGPT, other sources to the
% data pond (influxDB). At the moment, we are just using some test CSV 
% files. 
% 
% Not sure on:
% how to handle security, esp. with uploading to github. but, no worry for
% now, data retention policy is 30 days unless we pay. Long term, we should
% have cloud backup and slower, long term backup, as well as faster local
% server for at the track.
