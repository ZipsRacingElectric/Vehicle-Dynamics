% Process:
% Pull in Excel Data -> 
% Moment calculations -> 
% displacement calculations ->
% Find toe angle -> 
% Find compliance -> 
% plot resultsüê∏

%% This starts with the front left [FL] wheel and a moment causing 
% positive toe angle

clear, clc

%% 1. Pull in data from excel
% Here I use the "readtable" function. This pulls the data in as a table
% and automatically detects headers making it easy to call values or
% specific index values

Excel = readtable("\compliance_models\Compliance Testing ZR25.xlsx")
%% 2. Calculate moments
% To calculate our applied moments we need to know two variables. our lever
% arm length (L) and our applied force (F). 

% For this test our lever arm
% length never changed and the values is defined in the excel table. We can
% start by assinging this value a variable name.

dLeverArm = 1; % Lever arm length in meters.

% This is when we need to start being aware of what units we are working
% with. We know our final output should be in degrees/Nm. Because of this
% our distance values should all be in meters, our angle values should
% be in degrees, and our force values in newtons.

% Next we need to define our forces. Our force values are stored in a column titled Kg
% We can load the four differnet load cases into a matrix under one
% variable name.

forcesApplied = Excel.kg(1:4)

% This is an alternative way to call the same values by indexing their
% cells. Mass = Excel{1:4,1} 1:4 means rows 1 through 4 the , 1 pulls
% those rows from column 1

% Now we are ready to find our moments. Lets use a function for this. 

ToeMoments = GetMoment(forcesApplied,dLeverArm)
ToeMomentsRight = repmat(ToeMoments,4,1);
ToeMomentsLeft = repmat(ToeMoments,2,1)
%% 3. Find displacements of dial indicators
% to find the diplacements we need to calculate the difference between the
% movement of the two indicators for each of the four applied moment
% values. We do this for both sides of the car. This leaves us with
% 8 displacements to find from 16 numbers. Lets use another function to speed it up and
% then package all of the values in 2 easy to work with matrices, one for
% each wheel.

% First, assign variable names to the values of each dial indicator. 

Dial1 = Excel.indicator1(~isnan(Excel.indicator1));
Dial2 = Excel.indicator2(~isnan(Excel.indicator2));
Dial3 = Excel.indicator3(~isnan(Excel.indicator3));
Dial4 = Excel.indicator4(~isnan(Excel.indicator4));

% In the excel file these values were recorded in thousandths of an inch. We
% need to convert this to meters within our displacements function
% lets call the function and build our two, [4x1] matrices

DisplacementR = GetDisplacements(Dial1, Dial2) % displacement at corner
DisplacementL = GetDisplacements(Dial3, Dial4) % displacement at adjacent corner


% Using a function here has saved us 16 lines of calculations



%% 4. Find Toe Angles
% we almost have all the pieces we need to find our compliance. We have the
% values for the bottom of our triangles [DR, DL], the second side length of our
% triangle is defined in the excel, We have our corresponding forces [ToeMoments], 
% the last piece is finding the angle change using trig and our two triangle 
% sides. 

% Pull distance between the two indicators as measured in the setup this is
% the second tringle side.This was measured in inches so must also be
% converted to meters.

d = Excel{3,6};

% this pulls a single cell which can't easily be divided with the 4x1
% displacement matrices. We'll have to account for this in our function
             
toeBase = str2double(d{1}) * 0.0254;       % convert '15.5' ‚Üí 15.5 numeric


% now we can solve for the angles at each force interval. Naming convention
% toe angle on right side = TARS
TARS = GetComplianceAng(DisplacementR, toeBase); % corner side theta calc
TALS = GetComplianceAng(DisplacementL, toeBase); % adjacent side theta calc


%% Find compliance for each side (degrees per Nm) 
% we can divide the angle change by the corresponding force to find the
% angle change per applied Nm of force.

CRS = GetToeCompliance(TARS, ToeMomentsRight); % compliance at test corner
CLS = GetToeCompliance(TALS, ToeMomentsLeft); % compliance at adjacent corner

FrontRightPositive = TARS(1:4,1)
FrontLeftPositive = TALS(1:4,1)

FrontRightNegative = TARS(5:8,1)
FrontLeftNegative = TALS(5:8,1)

RearRightPositive = TARS(9:12,1)
RearRightNegative = TARS(13:16,1)


%% 5. Plot the reults (should be linearish)

subplot(2,1,1)
plot(ToeMoments, FrontRightPositive, 'b', 'Marker','*')

ylabel("Degrees")

%% displacement function
function distance = GetDisplacements(D1in, D2in)
   
    % Calculate displacement based on the input values
   
       distance = (abs(D2in) + abs(D1in)) .* 0.0000254; % Convert from thousandths of an inch to meters
  
end

%% compliance function

function TC = GetToeCompliance(ang,Moment) % outputs degrees per Kg

    TC = ang/Moment;

end

%% Compliance angle function
function theta = GetComplianceAng(Dispx,Dispy)

    theta = rad2deg(atan(Dispx./Dispy)); 
    % here we use ./ to divide each element of the matrix by the scalar. 
end

%% moment function
% This function needs fed mass (Kg) and lever arm length (LAD)
% We start by writing what the output will be, in this case "moments".
% Next we define the name of our function "GetMoment" and put the
% arguements it will need in  parenthesis (FKg, LAD)

function moments = GetMoment(Kg, LAD) % get moments back in Nm

% We then write the driving equation using the variables defined in the title. 
    moments = Kg*LAD*9.81; % {kg*m*m/s^2) = Nm
